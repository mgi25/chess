# Swiss Chess League Manager

This repository contains a browser-based recreation of the original `SwissChessLeaguev4.xlsm` workbook backed by a Flask/SQLite API. The service keeps the same player roster, Round 1 pairings, and tournament rules while providing REST APIs, data persistence, and a modern interface for driving the tournament.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.11 or later
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)

## Installation & database setup

From the repository root run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m backend.scripts.migrate
python -m backend.scripts.seed
```

The virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated. `python -m backend.scripts.migrate` creates the SQLite schema in `backend/data/tournament.sqlite`, and `python -m backend.scripts.seed` loads the historical player roster plus the Round 1 pairings from the workbook.

## Running the application locally

Start the backend API (defaults to port 5000):

```bash
python -m backend.app
```

In a second terminal serve the static front-end (any static file server will work). For example, using Python‚Äôs built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server 4173
```

Open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) in your browser. The page is preconfigured to call the backend at `http://localhost:5000/api`, but you can override the base URL by setting `window.APP_API_BASE` before loading `src/app.js`.

## Verifying persistence

1. With both servers running, open the app and record a few match results or add manual score adjustments.
2. Refresh the page or close and reopen the browser tab.
3. The previously entered results and adjustments will reload from the SQLite database via the backend API, confirming that tournament state now survives page refreshes.

## Available features

- ‚úÖ REST backend exposing players, rounds, matches, standings, and adjustment endpoints with Swiss pairing enforcement.
- ‚úÖ Rules panel reproducing the explanatory text from the `Rules` worksheet.
- ‚úÖ Player directory containing the full contact list from the `Matches` worksheet.
- ‚úÖ Standings table with live win/draw/loss tallies, manual score adjustments, opponent history, and persisted totals.
- ‚úÖ Interactive match cards for every recorded round with automatic bye handling.
- ‚úÖ One-click generation of future rounds using a Swiss pairing algorithm that reuses the workbook logic while preventing rematches.

## Operational tips

- Run `python -m backend.scripts.reset` to drop all rounds/results and reseed the database back to the workbook starting state.
- Always ensure every match in the current round has a recorded result before asking the backend to generate the next round.
- If an odd number of players needs pairing, the backend automatically awards a bye worth 1 point and prevents players from receiving multiple byes.
